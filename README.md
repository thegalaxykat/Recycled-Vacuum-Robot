# Recycled-Vacuum-Robot
High school capstone project for my IT seminar using parts from an old vacuum cleaner to build a remotely operated robot to drive anywhere in the school.

This was my first-ever attempt at integrated engineering using a Raspberry Pi. The Pi hosted a socket sever used to control the robot from a custom QT application.
